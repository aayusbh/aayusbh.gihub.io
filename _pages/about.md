Welcome to this corner of the internet! I'm Aayush Bhatta, a dedicated mechanical engineer and teaching assistant at Institute of Engineering, Tribhuvan University.
I work as a teaching assistant at [DMAE](https://mech.pcampus.edu.np/), Tribhuvan University.
If you have any questions, curiosities or would like to collaborate, please feel free to [contact me](aayushbhatta54@gmail.com)! 

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
